      <h2>About :</h2>
      <p>
        League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009
        multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by
        Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for
        Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in
        the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been
        free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
        customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS. In
        the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player
        combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of
        the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique
        abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become
        more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and
        purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode,
        Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and
        destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.
